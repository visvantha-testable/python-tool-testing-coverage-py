=============
Configuration
=============

This plugin provides a clean minimal set of command line options that are added to pytest. For
further control of coverage use a `coverage config file`_.

CLI options:

.. option:: --cov [SOURCE]

    Path or package name to measure during execution (multi-allowed). Use ``--cov=`` to not do any source filtering and record everything.

.. option:: --cov-reset

    Reset cov sources accumulated in options so far.

.. option:: --cov-report TYPE

    Type of report to generate: term, term-missing, annotate, html, xml, json, markdown, markdown-append, lcov (multi-allowed). term, term-missing may be followed by ":skip-covered".
    annotate, html, xml, json, markdown, markdown-append and lcov may be followed by ":DEST" where DEST specifies the output location. Use ``--cov-report=`` to not generate any output.

.. option:: --cov-config PATH

    Config file for coverage. Default: :file:`.coveragerc`

.. option:: --no-cov-on-fail

    Do not report coverage if test run fails. Default: False

.. option:: --no-cov

    Disable coverage report completely (useful for debuggers). Default: False

.. option:: --cov-fail-under MIN

    Fail if the total coverage is less than MIN.

.. option:: --cov-append

    Do not delete coverage but append to current. Default: False

.. option:: --cov-branch

    Enable branch coverage. Can also be specified in the `coverage config file`_ ``[run]`` section.

.. option:: --cov-precision COV_PRECISION

    Override the reporting precision. Can also be specified in the `coverage config file`_ ``[report]`` section.

.. option:: --cov-context CONTEXT

    Dynamic contexts to use. "test" for now.


.. note:: Important Note

    This plugin overrides the ``parallel`` option of coverage. Unless you also run coverage without pytest-cov it's
    pointless to set those options in your :file:`.coveragerc`.

    If you use the ``--cov=something`` option (with a value) then coverage's ``source`` option will also get overridden.
    If you have multiple sources it might be easier to set those in :file:`.coveragerc` and always use ``--cov`` (without a value)
    instead of having a long command line with ``--cov=pkg1 --cov=pkg2 --cov=pkg3 ...``.

    If you use the ``--cov-branch`` option then coverage's ``branch`` option will also get overridden.

If you wish to always run pytest-cov with pytest, you can use ``addopts`` under the ``pytest`` or ``tool:pytest`` section of
your :file:`setup.cfg`, or the ``tool.pytest.ini_options`` section of your :file:`pyproject.toml` file.

For example, in :file:`setup.cfg`: ::

    [tool:pytest]
    addopts = --cov=<project-name> --cov-report html

Or for :file:`pyproject.toml`: ::

    [tool.pytest.ini_options]
    addopts = "--cov=<project-name> --cov-report html"


.. note:: Important Note

    The ``--cov`` option has an optional argument. If it's your last option in addopts_ it might eat the next CLI argument, make sure to
    force it to take a blank value if that's what you wanted by using ``--cov=`` (essentially the same as ``--cov=""``).

Caveats
=======

An unfortunate consequence of coverage.py's history is that :file:`.coveragerc` is a magic name: it's the default file but it also
means "try to also lookup coverage configuration in :file:`tox.ini` or :file:`setup.cfg`".

In practical terms this means that if you have multiple configuration files around (:file:`tox.ini`, :file:`pyproject.toml` or :file:`setup.cfg`) you
might need to use ``--cov-config`` to make coverage use the correct configuration file.

Also, if you change the working directory and also use subprocesses in a test you might also need to use ``--cov-config`` to make pytest-cov
use the expected configuration file in the subprocess.
